# Homework 3

The data that you are working with in this assignment could not easily fit within a GitHub repository, so you will need to download it directly from the link provided in the PDF.

Then your primary responsibilities are inserting the data into an SQL table and then running a variety of queries doing different sorts of calculations to answer the questions on the PDF.
